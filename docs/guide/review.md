`tsrc` can automate part of the code review process.

You can use it with GitLab, GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or standard Git repositories.

# Handling GitLab merge requests

## Configuration

The first step is to log in to GitLab and get your personal access token.

Then, write a file in `~/.config/tsrc.yml` containing the token:

```yaml
auth:
  gitlab:
    token: <your token>
```

!!! note
    The full config file format is described in the [reference](../ref/formats.md).

The second step is to tell `tsrc` about the HTTP URL of your GitLab instance, which is needed to call the [GitLab HTTP API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/api/) (currently using version *4*).

This is done in the *manifest* file:

```yaml
gitlab:
  url: http://gitlab.local

repos:
 - ...
```

## Creating and accepting merge requests

Here's how you can create and assign a merge request:

```bash
# start working on your branch
$ tsrc push [--assignee ASSIGNEE]
```

If `ASSIGNEE` is set to a valid GitLab username, it will be used to assign the merge request.


When the review is done, you can accept it and let GitLab merge the branch once
the CI pipeline passes with the following command:

```bash
$ tsrc push --accept
```

# Handling GitHub & GitHub Enterprise pull requests

If there is a remote named `origin` and starting with `git@github.com`, `tsrc` will assume you want to use GitHub.

Alternatively, if GitHub Enterprise is configured in the *manifest* file such as:

```yaml
github_enterprise:
  url: http://github.local

repos:
 - ...
```
and there is a remote named `origin` which starts with `git@github.local`
(hostname of `github_enterprise.url` configuration) , `tsrc` will assume
you want to use GitHub Enterprise.

Then the first time you need access to GitHub API, it will ask for your credentials, generate a token and store it in the `~/.config/tsrc.yml` file.
In the event your GitHub Enterprise instance has a self-signed certificate the trust store can be configured in the `~/.config/tsrc.yml` file via:
```yaml
auth:
  github_enterprise:
    verify: <path to your crt file e.g. /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt | false to disable verification>
```

## Creating a pull request

Here's how to create a pull request and request reviewers:

```bash
# start working on your branch
$ tsrc push [--reviewer REVIEWER] [--assignee ASSIGNEE]
```
Here `REVIEWER` and `ASSIGNEE` should be usernames of members of your organization.

You can specify the `--reviewer` option several times, and you can also assign someone to the pull request with the `--assignee` option.


!!! note
    `tsrc` does not work across repositories yet. See [issue #73](https://github.com/TankerHQ/tsrc/issues/73).


## Merging or closing a pull request


Assuming you are on the correct branch, you can use `tsrc` to either merge or close the pull request, like so:

```bash
# Close
$ tsrc push --close

# Merge
$ tsrc push --merge
```

# Handling standard Git repositories

If `tsrc` can't determine to use GitLab, GitHub, or GitHub Enterprise it will push the changes to the remote repository
without creating any pull requests on the user's behalf.
